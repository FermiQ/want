WanT is an open-source, GNU General Public License suite of codes that provides an 
integrated approach for the study of coherent electronic transport in nanostructures. 

The core methodology combines state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory (DFT), 
plane-wave, norm-conserving pseudopotentials calculations with a Green's functions 
method based on the Landauer formalism to describe quantum conductance. 
The essential connection between the two, and a crucial step in the calculation, 
is the use of the maximally-localized Wannier function representation to introduce 
naturally the ground-state electronic structure into the lattice Green's function 
approach at the basis of the evaluation of the quantum conductance. 
Moreover, the knowledge of the Wannier functions of the system allows for the direct 
link between the electronic transport properties of the device with the nature of the 
chemical bonds, providing insight onto the mechanisms that govern electron flow 
at the nanoscale. 

The WanT package operates, in principles, as a simple post-processing of any 
standard electronic structure code. In its present version (1.0) the user 
will find a wrapper to run WanT from the results of a self-consistent 
calculation done using the Pwscf package (www.pwscf.org). 

WanT calculations will provide the user with: 
- Quantum conductance spectrum for a bulk (infinite, periodic) system and for a 
lead-conductor-lead geometry 
- Density of states spectrum in the conductor region 
- Centers and spreads of the maximally-localized Wannier functions of the system 

Current limitations (and planned developments): 
- Transport can be described only under quasi-equilibrium conditions (small bias, linear response) 
- Parallel execution of Wannier functions calculation is not implemented 
- Only norm-conserving (not ultrasoft) pseudopotentials can be used 
- Need of a uniform Monkhorst-Pack k-points grid (not Gamma only)
