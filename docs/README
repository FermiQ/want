Files in the directory:

README                the current file

CREDITS               the file acknowledging developers, contributors and
                      all the people who helped in maintaining and developing
                      the package. 

TODO                  the file containing the list of scheduled changes 

want_manual.pdf       the WanT Manual file. It is also possible to generate
                      the pdf file directly from the tex sources in tex/
                      using the reported Makefile.

                      Note that only want_manual.tex file should be compiled,

                      compile the code.
