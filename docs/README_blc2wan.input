NAMELIST &INPUT

prefix        STRING
              the first part of the name of all the file written by the code
              should be equal to the value given in the main calculations.
              DEFAULT: mandatory

postfix       STRING
              the tail of the names of the above mentioned files (useful e.g. to
              distinguish among different calculations having a common part).
              should be equal to the value given in the main calculations.
              DEFAULT: ""

work_dir      STRING
              the scratch directory where the massive data file are written
              DEFAULT: "./"

filein        STRING
              the name of the file containing the input operator in the Bloch
              representation
              DEFAULT: mandatory

fileout       STRING
              the name of the file containing the computed operator on the 
              Wannier basis
              DEFAULT: mandatory

binary        LOGICAL
              if .TRUE. the output file is written in binary iotk fmt.
              On the contrary, is it written in textual XML. 
              DEFAULT: .TRUE.

energy_ref    REAL
              For a dynamical operator, the energy grid is shifted to this energy
              reference. Useful to match Fermi energy between different calculations.
              DEFAULT: 0.0

spin_component    STRING
              ( "up" | "down" | "none" )
              define whether the calculation is spin polarized and if the case
              which spin component is to be treated.
              Note that only one component is written in the output file.
              DEFAULT: "none"

nprint        INTEGER
              When converting a dynamical operator, every nprint energy step write to stdout.
              DEFAULT: 10

verbosity     STRING
              ( "low" | "medium" | "high" )
              the level of detail of the output. In particular the code writes more about
              decay in stdout and also writes a data file in $work_dir/ containing the
              whole information about decay.
              DEFAULT: "medium"

debug_level   INTEGER
              level of debug report; values <= 0 switch the debug_mode off 
              DEFAULT: 0
