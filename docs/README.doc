=====================================================================

In the current directory it is possible to find more documentation
about the theory and the usage of Wannier functions for transport
calculations, as implemented in the WanT code.

Files in the directory:

README.doc      the current file
want_ug.pdf     the WanT USER-GUIDE. It is also possible to generate
                the pdf file directly from the tex sources in tex/

                $LATEX want_ug.tex     (also working with pdflatex)

                Note that all the other tex files should not be 
                compiled and are simply included in the main manual
