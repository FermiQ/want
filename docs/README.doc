              ********* WanT documentation **********

=====================================================================

In the current directory it is possible to find more documentation
about the theory and the usage of Wannier functions for transport
calculations, as implemented in the WanT code.

Files in the directory:

README.doc          the current file
want_manual.pdf     the WanT Manual file. It is also possible to generate
                    the pdf file directly from the tex sources in tex/
                    using the reported Makefile.

                    Note that only want_manual.tex file should be compiled,
                    while all the other tex sources are simply included 
                    in the main file.
