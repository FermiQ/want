 List of the known bugs

* G95: at least ultil Apr 2006, G95 with debug options
  (-g -fbounds-check -ftrace=full) is known to miscompile the 
  internal lapack & blas libraries distributed with WanT.
  Older versions of the compiler (last check Sep 2005) get
  a broken test08 (NaN apper without any reason). Fixed in newer
  version of the compiler.

* INTEL ifort 8.1 (and previous versions) 
  IOTK library is not properly working on large integer arrays.
  When the array dimension overcomes a given threshold IOTK
  scan (and sometimes write) gives an error.
  This is a well known bug of the intel compiler.
  Setting __IOTK_WORKAROUND3 in iotk_config.h file (IOTK_lib)
  allows to run the code anyway.
  #
  STATUS: fixed

* During recover (restart) procedure, but even in
  ordinary calculations, unitary checks fail without any clear reason.
  It happens on a IBM SP5 machine.
  It seems to be a bug of the XLF IBM compiler badly managing
  array dimensions through moduli and assumed shape interfaces.
  Results are correct anyway, since
  the failure involves only a check during the calculation: therefore
  it is possible to comment the checks (at the end of Libs/subspace_init.f90
  and Libs/localization_init.f90) to run the calculation anyway.
