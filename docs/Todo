  List of needed changes
*************************************

* tests: README in each test directory should be better written. They
         should contain the description of the input (main features) 
         and a commentof the outputs (why wannier functions can be considered
         converged ?, which are the key parameters in order to say that ? ... )

* plot.x: USPP features not fully implemented.

* disentangle + wannier: 
     - wfc stored in a k-indip array (waste small mem but
       increase performance)
     - scalar products in projections and overlaps by BLAS
               
* eigenchannel in transport calculation
* direct calculation of current
