            WanT code:  Log of Changes 
=======================================================

19 Dec 2004      Tests updated. Bug fixing in PWEXPORT-WANT interface.
                 FMT changed in overlap_module IO. (AF)

18 Dec 2004      SUMMARY subroutine completed with Gaussian centers data. Bugs fixed in 
                 WFC_READ_EXT. PROJECTION subroutine updated. Bug fixed in 
                 WANNIER_CENTERS_INIT routine. Disentangle is completely IOTK working.
                 Tests updated and checked. (AF)

17 Dec 2004      Read subroutines for DFT data renamed to *_read_ext (in order to 
                 distinguish with the routines used in the internal IO). Some variables
                 renamed according to PWSCF notation (mxdgve -> npw; npwx -> npwkx; 
                 wtkpt -> wk). window.f90 code is obsolescent. Summary routine completed.
                 Ggrids reading routine done. genbtr, spline, splint routines removed 
                 from CVS because no longer used. ZGEMM and ZGESVD removed from CVS
                 because the code is supposed to be linked with BLAS and LAPACK.
                 WFC_DATA module (managing projection and overlap calculation) added. (AF)

16 Dec 2004      Ions module rewritten, PW_EXPORT fmt modified. Pseudopotential files
                 read from DFT data, want_init and summary updated. (AF)

15 Dec 2004      Want_init procedure completed and checked; summary module added;
                 some cleaning up around done in order to locate all writing on stdout
                 at the beginning in summary routine. Routine new_bshells.f90 moved to
                 bshells.f90. (AF) 

08 Dec 2004      Want_init procedure started; lattice_module updated. (AF)

07 Dec 2004      Utility module (util.f90) updated (routine zmat_hdiag
                 added ); bug fixing in disentangle; References for tests
                 updated. (AF)
                 Further simplifications in Hamiltonian; IOTK fmt started to be
                 be used in disentangle instead of the launch.dat binary file. (AF)

04 Dec 2004      Hamiltonian code updated and sincronized with the
                 new IO fmt of other codes. Internal and output FMT of
                 Hamiltonian changed (not yet completed). 
                 Cleanup and startup routines updated. (AF)

01 Dec 2004      Utilities module updated. (AF)

30 Nov 2004      Bug in the units of gaussians (disentangle) fixed. 
                 Overlap_extract routine added and tested (do not re-compute overlaps 
                 and projections but used the data produced by disentangle).
                 PWs and wfc managing erased from wannier procedure.
                 Onfly.dat, unitary.dat and landing.dat deleted. Other IOTK data files
                 added. (AF) 

28 Nov 2004      IOTK fmt used for the internal data files.
                 Kpoints data collected in a module (update).
                 Overlap, Subspace, Windows modules added. (AF)

25 Nov 2004      Fized some portability bugs in the scripts: bash shell instead of
                 sh (thanks to Abinit guys). (AF)

20 Nov 2004      Severe bug in disentangle procedure fixed: nearest neighbor
                 shell indexes were crazy in some routines. Very often the
                 runtime execution was stable and only a minor error was produced;
                 some other times it was not. Wannier localization procedure is
                 usually poorly influenced by this change. (AF)

10 Nov 2004      Tests updated. Test1 and 2 renamed to 2 and 3; Test1 on bulk
                 silicon WFs added; Test4 about Al chains added. (AF) 
                 Various other updates in the test scripts.
