     Today is  5Apr2010 at 17:23: 9 

     Parallel version (MPI)

     Number of processors in use:       6
     R & G space division:  proc/pool =    6

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Waiting for input...
6 total processes killed (some possibly by mpirun during cleanup)
