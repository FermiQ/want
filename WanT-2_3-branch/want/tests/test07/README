@title@   Gold and Cobalt chains (2 atoms per cell)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculations for the bulk conductance of Gold and 
  Cobalt chains containing two atoms per unit cell. Calculations are performed 
  both with NC and US pseudopots for Gold and only with US pseudopot for Cobalt. 

  Disentanglement is computed within an energy window ranging up to 
  1.5 eV for Au; states are frozen from -20 eV to -2.5 eV.
  Twelve initial guess centers of atomic type are considered: 5 d-type and 1 
  s-type orbitals localized on each Au (or Co) atom (see the manual for further 
  details).

  Bulk-like conductance is calculated: leads and conductor are made of the same
  material and conductance of the ideal and infinite structure is computed.
  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.
  DOS is calculated as the trace of the conductor Green's function.


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in about 20 iterations for gold (about 40
  for AuUS and 60 for Co) and the final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is about 
  44.935 Bohr^2 for Au (40.644 Bohr^2 for AuUS and 33.240 Bohr^2 for Co), 
  3.744 Bohr^2 on average (3.387 Bohr^2 for AuUS and 2.770 Bohr^2 for Co): 
  this component of the spread will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 280 iterations Wannier convergence for gold (after 230 iterations 
  in the US case and 200 for cobalt) is achieved. A total spread of about 
  48.486 Bohr^2 for Au (43.940 Bohr^2 for AuUS, 35.232 Bohr^2 for Co) is found, 
  with an average of about 4.040 Bohr^2 for Au (3.662 Bohr^2 for AuUS, 2.936 Bohr^2 
  for Co).

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.dat and
  cond*.dat files.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_Au.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_Au.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_AuUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_AuUS.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_CoUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_CoUS.dat

  Conductance exhibits a stepwise behaviour due to the bulk-like calculation.
  Additional dips are present in the conductance plot compared with the calculations 
  performed with 1 atom per cell. This is obviously an artefact of the calculation.

  The reason can be traced as follows:
  The 2 atoms in the cell are not subjected to symmetric interactions (due to 
  the nearest enighbour interaction between principal layer, each gold atom 
  interacts up to 3 sites on one side but only upto 2 sites on the other side).

     L1   L2    C1   C2    R1   R2
  |  o    o  |  o    o  |  o    o |

       L          C          R

  As an example, atom C1 interacts with L1 (2 bonds) on the left and upto R2
  (3 bonds) on the right. Viceversa for C2. This essentially makes the two atoms
  in the conductor region to be inequivalent.

  This lack of symmetry causes the opening of gaps in bands structure,  and the
  corresponding dips in the conductance. 
  In order to correct this behavior we need to increase
  the number of atoms in the cell until interactions with the outermost atoms decay
  within the nearest neighbor principal layer coupling.
