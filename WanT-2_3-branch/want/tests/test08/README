@title@   Aluminum Chain + H impurity
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of an Aluminum 
  chain together with the full calculation for the case of the same chain with
  a Hydrogen impurity. 
  The results of the test can be compared with those in example12 of the 
  Espresso package (htp://www.pwscf.org). The same set of structural and other 
  simulation parameters are used in the two calculations in order to be as much 
  comparable as possible.

  The bulk chain is first treated with one atom (suffix _Al) in the unit cell, but also 
  using a 5 atoms (suffix _Al5). While there is no difference in the two calculations 
  at the Wannier function level, only the large cell gives properly converged results 
  for the transmitance.
  This is because the interaction in the wire is accounted up to the nearest neighbour
  principal layers ( here 1 princ. layer == 1 cell). The difference between the
  1-atom and 5-atom transmittance mainly concerns the position of band edges.
  These behaviors have been also described in details in the README files of test06 
  and test07.
 
  The effect of a Hydrogen impurity in the Al chain is also studied. While example12 
  in Espresso includes 5 Aluminum atoms in the conductor region, we need to include more 
  atoms in the chain for the same reasons as before: our calculation is therefore performed 
  using a cell with 10 Al atoms.

  The WanT input files set the froz_max parameter (see the manual for it precise meaning) 
  in order to exactly represent the lowest electronic states involved in the evaluation
  of transport properties.
  The "conditioned minimization" technique (using penalty functionals) is used in the
  case of the Hydrogen impurity to improve the matching procedure needed in the
  transmittance calculation.

  Results are reported in the following files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_Al.dat           transmittance for 1-atom  Al chain
     $TESTDIR/cond_Al5.dat          transmittance for 5-atoms Al chain
     $TESTDIR/cond_AlH.dat          transmittance for Al chain with H impurity
     $TESTDIR/cond_AlH_bulk.dat     transmittance for 1-atom Al chain obtained
                                    from the Al-H calculation

  Comparison with example12 results from Espresso takes place as follows:
  
  $TESTDIR/cond_Al5.dat    -->  example12/trans.alwire
  $TESTDIR/cond_AlH.dat    -->  example12/trans.alwireh

  Note that the different adopted units lead to a factor of 2 (espresso results should be 
  divided by 2 to be made comaprable)
