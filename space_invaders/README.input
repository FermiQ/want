CARD WANNIER_CENTER

Contains DIMWANN lines giving the trial centers for the WFs. 
Depending on the first integer in the line (GAUSS_TYP) which could be 1 or 2, 
the format is different:

ENDIF

IF ( gauss_typ == 2 ) THEN

            giving the angular part of the trial WF. l can be set equal to 0, 1, or 2, 
            (and m values are then as usual) for standard spherical harmonics or l == -1
            indicate the sp^3 geometry. Here spherical armonics are the real ones:
            l == -1:   m = -4 -->   1, 1,-1 dir  
                       m = -3 -->   1,-1, 1 dir

                       m =  4 -->  -1,-1, 1 dir
            l == 0 :   m =  0 -->  no problem
            l == 1 :   m = -1 -->  x 
                       m =  0 -->  z

            l == 2 :   m = -2 -->  x^2 - y^2

                       m =  0 -->  3z^2 - r^2
                       m =  1 -->  yz
                       m =  2 -->  xy 
          
   ndir     INTEGER
            specifies which is the z direction for the spherical harmonics.
            the possible values are 1, 2 or 3 (suggested value 3)
   

   rloc     REAL
            specifies the spread [Bohr] of the gaussian used for the radial part of the 
            trial WF


In the case GAUSS_TYP == 2, 
   x,y,z    REAL
            as before for GAUSS_TYP == 1
     
 xx,yy,zz   REAL
            as before for x,y,z for the units, specify the center of a second gaussian 
            used to build up the trial WF. This second case could be useful to describe
            anti-bonding WF.

  rloc      REAL
            as before for GAUSS_TYP == 1
