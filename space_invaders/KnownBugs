 List of the known bugs
****************************************


* INTEL ifort 8.1 (and previous versions) 
  IOTK library is not properly working on large integer arrays.
  When the array dimension overcomes a given threshold IOTK
  scan (and sometimes write) gives an error.
  This is a well known bug of the intel compiler.
  Setting __IOTK_WORKAROUND7 in iotk_config.h file (IOTK_lib)
  allows to run the code anyway.

* sometimes, during recover (restart) procedure in wannier, 
  unitary checks fails without any clear reason.
  bug under study.

* In transport calculations, spikes lowering the conductance 
  of some units may appear. They are very often due to a 
  slight numerical misalignment of the electronic structure
  in the lead-conductor-lead system.
