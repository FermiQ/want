  List of needed changes
*************************************

* Wannier - conductor interface
* Wannier: bshell elimination
* disentangle:  overlap updated to be better implemented
                (waste a little bit of memory but twice as fast)
* plot.x: USPP features not fully implemented.
* tests: strange spikes (test2 and 5) to be checked 
* test6: add a true transport calculation test
* WanT:  a true manual (as the one in docs) is missing. 
         we need e.g. to explain better the choice of Wannier centers
* tests: README in each test directory should be better written. They
         should contain the description of the input (main features) 
         and a commentof the outputs (why wannier functions can be considered
         converged ?, which are the key parameters in order to say that ? ... )

* repository restyling (too much noise in the main dir)
* portability issues, checks on various architectures
* kpts in transport calculations
* eigenchannel in transport calculation
