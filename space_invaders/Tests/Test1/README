TEST1   Silicon bulk (NCPP & USPP)
==============================================================================

Wannier function calculation for Silicon bulk. No transport calculation is performed. 
THe band structure along standard symmetry lines is computed by PWSCF (see the file
/Reference/nscf_band.dat) and then recalculated by interpolation on the Wannier 
function Hamiltonian. A comparison shows that valence bands are exactly represented 
as expected while small discrepancies arise in the high energy region.  This is due 
to the disentangle procedure which selects an optimal subspace (in the sence od WF 
localization) out of the starting manyfold.
