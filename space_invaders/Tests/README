TEST1

This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of a Gold chain.
The calculation is done setting one atom in the unit cell, using a (1 1 4, 0 0 1) 
(according to PWSCF notation) Monkrost-Pack grid in the SCF run and a (1 1 4, 0 0 0) 
grid in the NSCF run. The wave-function and charge-density cutoff has been chosen 
to be 20 Ry in order to make the test running fast, but results are of course 
not converged. A cutoff of 40 Ry of more will lead to more physical results.
Wannier functions for the s-d manyfold (6-dim) of Gold are computed using also
the disentanglement procedure, and transmittance is calculated through the BULK.x code.

The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos.out and cond.out
files in the Test1 dir.
