Calculation of valence band transmittance for a dimerized Carbon chain (polyyne).
The computation is first done using "bulk.x" code starting from a bulk unit cell
containing 4 C atoms. Then the same is done coupling different lead and conductor
calculations: 2 atoms per cell have been used for the leads while 4 for the conductor.
We used 8 kpts along chain direction for the leads and 4 kpts for the
conductor to sampling Brillouin zone, and a cutoff of 20 Ry. 
As before, numerically safer results are obtained with higher cutoff (not less than 40 Ry).

The output of the calculations are the conductance (namely the transmittance) 
and dos from "bulk.x" code (cond_bulk.out and dos_bulk.out) and from 
"conductor.x" (cond.out and dos.out).

The difference between the two (results from conductor are less converged) is due
to the number of atoms in the lead cell giving rise to a poor description of the
so-called "principal layer" (you can try to increase the number of atoms to 8 and 16
in the lead and conductor calculations).
