# ENVIRONMENT variables
#
#================================================================
#
# Contains the common variables to be set by the user
# before running tests.
#
# These variables are:
#
# DFT_BIN       the directory contining the executables of
#               DFT package    
# TMPDIR        the directory where massive data are written
#               during the calculation (scratch dir)
#               This dir must be created by the user and the 
#               run script just makes one sub-dir for each test
# PARA_PREFIX   for parallel architectures the MPI launch sintax
# PARA_POSTFIX  must be specified by setting these two variables,
#               (PARA_PREFIX could be mpirun, mpprun, poe ..., and 
#               PARA_POSTFIX could handle some information about 
#               processor number, etc etc)
#               Leave them empty for serial machines or when not needed
