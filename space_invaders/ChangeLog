            WanT code:  Log of Changes 
=======================================================

04 Dec 2004      Hamiltonian code updated and sincronized with the
                 new IO fmt of other codes. Internal and output FMT of
                 Hamiltonian changed (not yet completed). 
                 Cleanup and startup routines updated. (AF)

01 Dec 2004      Utilities module updated. (AF)

30 Nov 2004      Bug in the units of gaussians (disentangle) fixed. 
                 Overlap_extract routine added and tested (do not re-compute overlaps 
                 and projections but used the data produced by disentangle).
                 PWs and wfc managing erased from wannier procedure.
                 Onfly.dat, unitary.dat and landing.dat deleted. Other IOTK data files
                 added. (AF) 

28 Nov 2004      IOTK fmt used for the internal data files.
                 Kpoints data collected in a module (update).
                 Overlap, Subspace, Windows modules added. (AF)

25 Nov 2004      Fized some portability bugs in the scripts: bash shell instead of
                 sh (thanks to Abinit guys). (AF)

20 Nov 2004      Severe bug in disentangle procedure fixed: nearest neighbor
                 shell indexes were crazy in some routines. Very often the
                 runtime execution was stable and only a minor error was produced;
                 some other times it was not. Wannier localization procedure is
                 usually poorly influenced by this change. (AF)

10 Nov 2004      Tests updated. Test1 and 2 renamed to 2 and 3; Test1 on bulk
                 silicon WFs added; Test4 about Al chains added. (AF) 
                 Various other updates in the test scripts.
