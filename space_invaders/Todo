  List of needed changes
*************************************

* Wannier: bshell elimination

* WanT:  a true manual (as the one in docs) is missing. 
         we need e.g. to explain better the choice of Wannier centers

* tests: README in each test directory should be better written. They
         should contain the description of the input (main features) 
         and a commentof the outputs (why wannier functions can be considered
         converged ?, which are the key parameters in order to say that ? ... )

* repository restyling (too much noise in the main dir)
* plot.x: USPP features not fully implemented.

* disentangle: 
     - overlap updating should be better implemented
       (waste a little bit of memory but twice as fast)
     - wfc stored in a k-indip array (waste small mem but
       may increase performance)
     - scalar products in projections and overlaps by BLAS
               
* kpts in transport calculations
* eigenchannel in transport calculation
* direct calculation of current
