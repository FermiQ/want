GENERAL DESCRIPTION

WanT is an open-source, GNU General Public License suite of codes that provides an 
integrated approach for the study of coherent electronic transport in nanostructures. 

The core methodology combines state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory (DFT), 
plane-wave, norm-conserving pseudopotentials calculations with a Green's functions 
method based on the Landauer formalism to describe quantum conductance. 
The essential connection between the two, and a crucial step in the calculation, 
is the use of the maximally-localized Wannier function representation to introduce 
naturally the ground-state electronic structure into the lattice Green's function 
approach at the basis of the evaluation of the quantum conductance. 
Moreover, the knowledge of the Wannier functions of the system allows for the direct 
link between the electronic transport properties of the device with the nature of the 
chemical bonds, providing insight onto the mechanisms that govern electron flow 
at the nanoscale. 

The WanT package operates, in principles, as a simple post-processing of any 
standard electronic structure code. In its present version (1.0) the user 
will find a wrapper to run WanT from the results of a self-consistent 
calculation done using the Pwscf package (www.pwscf.org). 

WanT calculations will provide the user with: 
- Quantum conductance spectrum for a bulk (infinite, periodic) system and for a 
lead-conductor-lead geometry 
- Density of states spectrum in the conductor region 
- Centers and spreads of the maximally-localized Wannier functions of the system 

Current limitations (and planned developments): 
- Transport can be described only under quasi-equilibrium conditions (small bias, linear response) 
- Parallel execution of Wannier functions calculation is not implemented 
- Only norm-conserving (not ultrasoft) pseudopotentials can be used 
- Need of a uniform Monkhorst-Pack k-points grid (not Gamma only)

DISCLAIMER

While the developers of WanT make every effort to deliver a high quality scientific software, 
we do not guarantee that our codes are free from defects. Our software is provided "as is". 
Users are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using this package and 
assume all risks associated with the use of it, including but not limited to the risks of 
program errors, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or 
interruption of operations. Due to the limited human resources involved in the development 
of this software package, no support will be given to individual users for either installation 
or execution of the codes.
Finally, in the spirit of every open source project, any contribution from external users is welcome, 
encouraged and, if appropriate, will be included in future releases.
