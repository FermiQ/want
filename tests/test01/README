  @title@   Silicon bulk (NCPP & USPP)
==============================================================================
  
  Wannier function calculation for Silicon bulk. No transport calculation is done. 
  All calculations are performed using both NC and US pseudopotentials.
  The band structure along standard symmetry lines is computed by the DFT code
  (see the file $TESTDIR/Reference/nscf_band.dat) and then recalculated by 
  interpolation on the Wannier function Hamiltonian. 
  
  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to 
  14.8 eV (with lower-bond of -13 eV lower-bond in the US case), in order to 
  obtain 8 Wannier functions. Eight initial guess centers are considered: 4 
  of them are of 1gauss type, localized on the Si atoms with a hybridized sp3 
  geometry, and 4 are of 2gauss type (see the manual for further details). 


  RESULTS discussion

  Nearest neighbours b-shell vectors, computed by disentangle.x, and DFT eigenvalues 
  are reported on the disentangle output file. Disentangle convergence is achieved
  in about 50 iterations (70 for US pseudopot) and the final invariant spread 
  (\Omega_I) is about 46.039 Bohr^2 (5.755 Bohr^2 on average) for NC pseudopot and 
  47.242 Bohr^2 (5.905 Bohr^2 on average) for US: this component of the spread will 
  remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.
  In general, \Omega_I is very sensitive to the selected energy window and can also 
  be influenced by the choice of the starting centers. 
  The convergence in disentangle calculation is, in general, faster than the one in 
  Wannier localization.

  After 5000 iteration Wannier convergence is not fully achieved but can be considered 
  adequate.  A total spread of about 59.788 Bohr^2 is found (70.831 Bohr^2 for US pseudo),
  with an average of about 7.473 Bohr^2 (8.854 Bohr^2 for US pseudo).
  In some iteration steps the value of the spread can abruptly increase, but this is 
  due to the well-known behaviour of the complex logarithm used in the definition of 
  the spreads (see the manual for more details).

  Some points for verifying the computed localization of Wannier functions are:

      * Average invariant spread is quite small (not very small, due to the 
        presence of conduction states in required Wannier subspace).

      * Final average total spreads are reasonable (while values over 15 - 20 Bohr^2
        should be definitely considered too large)

      * Since well-localized WFs are expected (by conjecture) to be almost real, the
        Hamiltonian matrix elements should be nearly real. See the end of wannier.out 
        file where these matrix elements are reported.

      * The spatial decay of the hamiltonian on the WF basis H(R) is well behaved. 
        Usually a nearly exponential decay wrt R is expected.

      * The calculation of interpolated bands (computed by bands.x) can be used as 
        a further check too:
        a comparison with DFT band structure shows that valence bands are exactly
        represented as expected while small discrepancies arise in the high energy region. 
        The files to be plotted are: 
            $TESTDIR/Reference/dft_bands.dat
            $TESTDIR/SCRATCH/silicon_WanT_intband.dat  (or silicon_US if the case)
        This is due to the disentanglement procedure which selects an optimal subspace 
        (in the sense of WF localization) out of the starting Bloch manyfold.
  
        The effect of disentanglement on the Wannier subspace can also be seen in the
        files:
            $TESTDIR/SCRATCH/silicon_WanT_dftband.dat  
            $TESTDIR/SCRATCH/silicon_WanT_wanband.dat  
        describing Bloch eigenvalues before and after the disentanglement procedure.
  

   Norm-conserving and Ultra-soft calculations show some small differences which
   can be safely attributed to the pseudopotentials and their pseudization types.
