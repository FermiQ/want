@title@   Silicon bulk (NCPP & USPP)
==============================================================================
  
  Wannier function calculation for Silicon bulk. No transport calculation is done. 
  All calculations are performed using both NC and US pseudopotentials.
  The band structure along standard symmetry lines is computed by the DFT code
  (see the file $TESTDIR/Reference/dft_bands.dat) and then recalculated by 
  interpolation on the Wannier function Hamiltonian. 
  
  We compute 4 WFs, spanning the valence manyfold. 
  Four initial guess centers are considered: all of them are of 1gauss type (s-symmetry), 
  localized on 4 bonds corresponding to sp3 hybridization.

  At the end of this file, we report an example of input file to compute
  8 WFs corresponding to the valence bands plus the first 4 conduction bands.


  RESULTS discussion

  Nearest neighbours b-shell vectors, computed by disentangle.x, and DFT eigenvalues 
  are reported on the disentangle output file. Disentangle convergence is achieved
  immediatly (1 iteration) since the subspace of WFs is already defined as the
  valence band manyfold. Note that this is the case because we computed only the valence 
  bands from the DFT calculations.
  The invariant part of the spread (\Omega_I), obtained at the end of the disentangle procedure,
  will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After 8500 iterations, Wannier convergence is not fully achieved but can be considered 
  adequate.  

  Some points for verifying the computed localization of Wannier functions are:

      * Final average total spreads are reasonable (here we see values in the 
        range 7 - 8 Bohr^2, while values over 20 -- 50 Bohr^2
        should be definitely considered too large)

      * Since well-localized WFs are expected (by conjecture) to be almost real, the
        Hamiltonian matrix elements should be nearly real. See the end of wannier.out 
        file where these matrix elements are reported.

      * The spatial decay of the Hamiltonian on the WF basis H(R) is well behaved, 
        Usually a nearly exponential decay wrt R is expected, as it is the case here.

      * The calculation of interpolated bands (computed by bands.x) can be used as 
        a further check:
        a comparison with DFT band structure shows that valence bands are almost exactly
        represented.

        Files to be plotted to this purpose are: 
            $TESTDIR/Reference/dft_bands.dat
            $TESTDIR/bands.dat               (or bands_US.dat  for USPP)
  

  Norm-conserving and Ultra-soft calculations show some small differences which
  are attributed to the pseudopotentials and their different 
  pseudization types.



  COMPUTING WFs FOR EMPTY STATES

  to compute WFs for some (the lowest lying) empty states, follow these instructions: 
  
      * enlarge the number of bands computed by DFT (add nbnd = 16 in nscf.in)
      * change the WanT input file according to:

      &CONTROL
       ...
      /

      &SUBSAPCE
         dimwann = 8
         win_max =  14.95    !  cut at a certain point the eigenvalue window
      /

      &LOCALIZATION
       ...
      /
