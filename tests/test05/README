@title@   Spontaneous polarization of AlN Wurtzite wrt ZincBlend
==============================================================================

  Spontaneous polarization of AlN Wurtzite wrt Zincblende from the 
  calculation of Wannier functions.
  All calculation are performed using both NC and US pseudopots.
  The localization of the WFs is carried out in both AlN structures 
  (ZB and WZ), in order to compute the electronic part of the spontaneous 
  polarization in the WZ as the difference with the centrosymmetric ZB structure 
  (the ZB spontaneous polarization is assumed to be zero).
  
  The electronic part of the spontaneous polarization is calculated as:
  
  DeltaP = (2*e/V) * DeltaR
  
  where DeltaP stands for the difference in polarization between WZ and ZB, e is
  the electronic charge, V the cell volume and DeltaR is the difference in the 
  sum of Wannier centers between the 2 structures.

  All calculations are done in the same hexagonal cell for both ZB and WZ.

  Only occupied states (valence band) are considered, therefore Wannier 
  calculations is performed using 24 Wannier functions. Twenty-four initial 
  guess centers of 1gauss type are set, localized at the bond midpoints 
  (see the manual for further details). 


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration, because only the occupied 
  states are required in the calculation. The final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is 
  about 64.374 Bohr^2 for ZB (2.682 Bohr^2 on average), about 64.289 Bohr^2 for WZ 
  (2.679 Bohr^2 on average), about 64.547 Bohr^2 for ZBUS (2.689 Bohr^2 on average)
  and about 64.500 Bohr^2 for WZUS (2.687 Bohr^2 on average): this component of the 
  spread will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 620 iterations (690 for US) Wannier convergence for ZB is achieved. 
  A total spread of about 77.164 Bohr^2 (77.011 Bohr^2 for US) is found, with an
  average of about 3.215 Bohr^2 (3.209 Bohr^2 for US).
  After 2000 iterations Wannier convergence for wurtzite is not fully achieved but
  can be considered adequate. A total spread of about 77.300 Bohr^2 is found 
  (77.186 Bohr^2 for WZUS), with an average of about 3.221 Bohr^2 (3.216 Bohr^2 for 
  WZUS).

  Note that, to the purpose of polarization calculation, Wannier localization 
  (performed by wanier.x) is not strictly necessary. The sum of the center positions
  is in fact invariant wrt unitary transformation of the WFs. As the Omega_I 
  contribution to the total spread, this quantity depends only on the valence states
  manyfold.

  The difference in spontaneous electronic polarization between the two structures 
  is calculated both in the NC and US pseudopotentials case and it is 
  in good agreement with previous results.
