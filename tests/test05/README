@title@   Spontaneous polarization of AlN Wurtzite wrt ZincBlend
==============================================================================

  Spontaneous polarization of AlN Wurtzite wrt Zincblende from Wannier functions
  calculation. All calculation are performed using both NC and US pseudopots.
  The localization of the Wannier centers is carried out in both AlN structures 
  (ZB and WZ), in order to calculate the electronic part of the spontaneous 
  polarization in the WZ as the difference from the centrosymmetric ZB structure 
  (the ZB spontaneous polarization is assumed to be zero).
  
  The electronic part of the spontaneous polarization is calculated as:
  
  DeltaP = (2*e/V) * DeltaR
  
  where DeltaP stands for the difference in polarization between WZ and ZB, e is
  the electronic charge, V the cell volume and DeltaR is the difference in the 
  Wannier centers sum between the 2 structures.

  All calculation are done in the same hexagonal cell for both ZB and WZ.

  Only occupied states are considered, therefore Wannier calculation is performed 
  using 24 Wannier functions. Twenty-for initial guess centers of 1gauss type are 
  set, localized at the bond midpoints (see the manual for further details). 


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration, because only the occupied 
  states are required in calculation. The final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is about
  64.374 Bohr^2 for ZB (2.682 Bohr^2 on average), about 64.289 Bohr^2 for WZ 
  (2.679 Bohr^2 on average), about 64.560 Bohr^2 for ZBUS (2.690 Bohr^2 on average)
  and about 64.482 Bohr^2 for WZUS (2.687 Bohr^2 on average): this component of the 
  spread will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 620 iterations (690 for US) Wannier convergence for ZB is achieved. 
  A total spread of about 77.162 Bohr^2 (77.027 Bohr^2 for US) is found, with an
  average of about 3.215 Bohr^2 (3.209 Bohr^2 for US).
  After 2000 iterations Wannier convergence for cobalt is not fully achieved but
  can be considered reached. A total spread of about 19.421 Bohr^2 is found (with
  an average of about 3.237 Bohr^2).
