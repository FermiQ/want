@title@   Isolated benzene molecule (both NC and USPP)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculation of the Wannier functions for the
  isolated benzene molecule, both in the norm-conserving and ultra-soft
  pseudopotential case. The molecule is oriented in the xy plane. 

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to 
  2.0 eV. A conditioned minimization is carried out and the amplitude of the 
  penalty functional is set to 20 (see the manual for further details about 
  conditioned minimization). 
  Eighteen initial guess centers are considered: 12 of 1gauss-type with s-geometry, 
  localized at the bond midpoints and 6 s-type atomic orbitals,localized on the 
  C atoms. The last number near each starting center coordinates is the value 
  of the center weight in the penalty functional expression.
  A value of 1.0 is standard, while a value of 0.0 would make the center not 
  entering the expression for the penalty functional. This would result in no
  constrain on that center.
  

  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in about 50 iterations for NC pseudopots 
  (about 90 for US pseudopots) and the final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is 
  about 66.457 Bohr^2 for NC pseudopots (66.794 Bohr^2 for US pseudopots), 
  3.692 Bohr^2 on average (3.711 Bohr^2 for US): this component of the spread
  will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization. Nota that these values 
  are very sensitive to the energy window chosen in the disentanglement, but are
  not modified by the conditioning penalty functional.

  After about 560 iterations Wannier convergence for NC pseudopots is achieved 
  (670 iterations in the US case).
  A total spread of about 102.205 Bohr^2 for NC (104.399 Bohr^2 for US) is found,
  with an average of about 5.678 Bohr^2 for NC (5.780 Bohr^2 for US).

  In both cases the computed localization of Wannier functions is verified:

      * Average invariant spread is small (around 3.7 Bohr^2).

      * Final average total spreads are small (around 5.7 Bohr^2). 

   It can be verified that if a not-conditioned minimization is performed the 
   same final positions for WF centers are not recovered and the localization 
   procedure basically fail. 
   Total spread is lower, since we have no penalty functional, but 
   some wannier functions (at least one) move to the vacuum region. This results
   in having the other WFs to better fit in the molecular region. While the 
   states out of the molecule have huge spreads, those near the molecule can
   better localize themselves, since no constrain of orthonormality with the
   missing functions is present. The balance is positive on the total spread
   but is usually useless since localization is not found.

   Norm-conserving and Ultra-soft calculations work almost the same.
