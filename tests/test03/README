@title@   Isolated benzene molecule (both NC and USPP)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculation of the wannier functions for the
  isolated benzene molecule, both in the norm-conserving and ultra-soft
  pseudopotential case. The molecule is oriented in the xy plane. 

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to 
  2.0 eV. A conditioned minimization is carried out and the amplitude of the 
  penalty functional is set to 20 (see the manual for further details). 
  Eighteen initial guess centers are considered: 12 of 1gauss-type with s-geometry, 
  localized at the bond midpoints and 6 s-type atomic orbitals,localized on the 
  C atoms (see the manual for further details).The last number near each starting 
  center coordinates is the value of the center weight in the penalty functional 
  expression.
  

  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in about 50 iterations for NC pseudopots 
  (about 90 for US pseudopots) and the final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is 
  about 66.457 Bohr^2 for NC pseudopots (66.794 Bohr^2 for US pseudopots), 
  3.692 Bohr^2 on average (3.711 Bohr^2 for US): this component of the spread
  will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 560 iterations Wannier convergence for NC pseudopots is achieved 
  (670 iterations in the US case).
  A total spread of about 102.205 Bohr^2 for NC (104.399 Bohr^2 for US) is found,
  with an average of about 5.678 Bohr^2 for NC (5.780 Bohr^2 for US).

  In both cases the computed localization of Wannier functions is verified:

      * Average invariant spread is small.

      * Final average total spreads are small.

   It can be verified that if a not conditioned minimization is performed the 
   center positions are not exactly inidviduated and the localization procedure
   fail.

   Norm-conserving and Ultra-soft calculations show some small differences 
   which can be safely attributed to the pseudopotentials and their pseudization 
   types.
