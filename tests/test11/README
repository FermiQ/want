==============================================================================

  Calculation of conductance for a Pt-H2-Pt junction. The calculation is done 
  setting a chain of 8 Pt atoms with an H2 molecule between them in the unit cell.
  We used 4 kpts along chain direction to sample the Brillouin zone, and a cutoff 
  of 22 Ry for wfc (while 176 Ry for rho).
  The calculations are performed both using a lead principal layer of 1 and 
  4 Pt atoms. For this reason, we adopted the following naming scheme:

  *_bulk1*    files related the the bulk Pt, using 1 atom per cell
  *_bulk4*    files related the the bulk Pt, using 4 atoms per cell

  conductor_lead1.*    files related to a transport calculation using
              data for the leads from *_bulk1*
  conductor_lead4.*    files related to a transport calculation using
              data for the leads from *_bulk4*
  conductor_auto.*     files related to a transport calculation using
              data for the leads from the same conductor calculation
              (this is meant to be more of a demonstration than a
               real input choice and it is not recommended in real calculations)

  At first, the WFs are computed for the isolated systems (the conductor region,
  and the leads, both 1 and 4 atoms per cell).
  DOS and bands are computed for the leads to ensure that the electronic structure
  is well described. 
  The bulk trnasmittance is also computed for bulk1 and bulk4 as a references.
  Here some differences can be found, due to the different size of the principal 
  layers in the two cases: 1 atom PL is not enough while 4 atoms PL is almost converged.

  The main output of the transport calculations is the full conductance across the
  junction, computed in different flavors:
  - conductor_lead1.in:    using 1 Pt-atom principal layers (data from bulk1)
  - conductor_lead4.in:    using 4 Pt-atoms principal layers (data from bulk4)
  - conductor_auto.in:     using 1 Pt-atom principal layers (data from the conductor region)
  
  The current corresponding to the lead1 and lead4 calculations is also computed. 

RESULTS discussion

  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_bulk1.dat   
     $TESTDIR/cond_bulk4.dat   
     $TESTDIR/cond_lead1.dat        
     $TESTDIR/cond_lead4.dat        
     $TESTDIR/cond_auto.dat        

  In the bulk-like calculation, conductance exhibits a stepwise behavior, with the
  presence of dips due to the lack of symmetry in the simulated interactions. 
  When we compute the transmittance for the Pt-H2-Pt junction we observe the 
  depletion of large part of the Pt d channels. Again, numerical noise (basically
  connected with the matching procedure when small cells are used, as in the present 
  case) produces some dips in the transmittance (and in the DOS correspondingly).

  According to these results, the automethod is more noisy than the others,
  reflecting the fact that a good description of the leads is very important.
  To our experience this is a general feature not restricted to this test only. 

  Results may be checked with a published work which uses the same approach based
  on Wannier functions: 
    K.S. Thygesen and K.W. Jacobsen, Chem. Phys. 319, 111-125 (2005). 

  As an example, we also compute the current in the "linear regime", i.e. considering
  the transmittance indipendend on the applied bias. The output result is given
  in the file $TESTDIR/current.dat .
