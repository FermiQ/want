@title@   Au-BDA-Au junction: eigenchannel plotting
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  This test shows how to perform a transport calculation
  on a molecular jucntion made by 1D gold atomic chains connected to
  the BDA molecule.
  This test is meant to show a very classical example of transport
  calculation, focusing on the plotting of transmittance and eigenchannels.
