@title@   H2 molecule @ graphene standing layer
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  This test shows how to perform a calculation using embed.x
  First we compute WFs for a layer of graphene with an adsorbed H2 molecule.
  Then the DOS and pDOS are evaluated using dos.x (also including a model self-energy) .
  At this point, we just focus on the H2 molecule, and treat the graphene layer as a bath,
  thereby defining an embedding self-energy. The DOS projected on the H2 molecule
  is then evaluated using this special technique, with and without the inclusion
  of a simple (but non-hermitean) static self-energy (just providing a further 
  smearing term).
  The use of gaussian smearing is also considered.

  The dos files provided by embed.x can be compared with the projdos files generated
  by dos.x, according to the following:

  dos_H2embed.dat           <-->   SCRATCH/lorentzian_H2graph_WanT_dos-0001.dat 
  dos_gau_H2embed.dat       <-->   SCRATCH/gaussian_H2graph_WanT_dos-0001.dat 
  dos_sgm_H2embed.dat       <-->   SCRATCH/sigma_H2graph_WanT_dos-0001.dat
