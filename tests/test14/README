@title@   H2 molecule @ graphene and Al standing layer
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  This test shows how to perform a calculation using embed.x
  First we compute WFs for a layer of graphene or Al atoms with an adsorbed H2 molecule.
  Then the DOS and pDOS are evaluated using dos.x .
  At this point, we just focus on the H2 molecule, and treat the Al as a bath,
  giving rise to an embedding self-energy. The DOS projected on the H2 molecule
  is then evaluated using this special technique, with and without the inclusion
  of a simple (but non-hermitean) static self-energy (just providing a further 
  smearing term).
