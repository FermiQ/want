@title@   CP2K and ATMPROJ Hamiltonians
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  This test shows how to use CP2K and ATMPROJ Hamiltonians to interpolate
  the electronic structure of few selected systems. Bands, dos, and transmittance
  are computed and compared with direct calculations.

  A number of systems are tested: bulk Silicon, poly-acethylene chains, gold chains,
  and the benzene molecule
