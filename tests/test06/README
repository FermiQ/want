@title@   Gold and Cobalt chains (NCPP and USPP)
==============================================================================

This test performs the calculations for the bulk conductance of Gold and Cobalt chains.
The calculation is done setting one atom in the unit cell, using a (1 1 4, 0 0 1) 
(according to PWSCF notation) Monkrost-Pack grid in the SCF run and a (1 1 4, 0 0 0) 
grid in the NSCF run. 
The wave-function and charge-density cutoff in the NCPP case has been chosen 
to be 20 Ry in order to make the test running fast, but results are of course 
not converged. A cutoff of 40 Ry of more will lead to more physical results.
In the USPP case instead cutoff of 20 and 200 Ry are used for wfc and rho respectively.
Note the larger ration wfc/rho cutoffs which is due to the hardness of augmentation
charges needed within USPP.
Wannier functions for the s-d manifold (6-dim) of Gold are computed using also
the disentanglement procedure, and transmittance is calculated through the bulk.x code.

The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.out and cond*.out
files

RESULTS
  Note that the final transmittance are slightly different probably due to the 
  different convergence level between NC and USPP (the second case is more close to
  convergence, which is around 25 Ry for wfc and 200 Ry for rho cutoff energies)
