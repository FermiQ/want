TEST5  Gold chain bulk within Ultra Soft pseudo-potentials (USPP)
==============================================================================

This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of a Gold chain
as in Test2. The main difference is the here we adopt USPP instead of normal NCPP
which requires the inclusion of augmentation terms both in overlap and projection
calculation. The parameters of the DFT computations are exacly the same as before
apart the kinetic energy cutoff which here is 20 Ry for the wfcs and 200 Ry for the 
density.

NOTE: if the cutoff for the density is lowered downto 160 Ry a WARNING is given
      by wannier.x (and an error by hamiltonian.x) because the U rotations are
      not strictly unitary. This is clearly due to USPP.
