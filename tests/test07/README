@title@   Gold and Cobalt chains (2 atoms per cell)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculations for the bulk conductance of a Gold and 
  Cobalt chains containing 2 atoms per unit cell. Calculations are performed 
  both with NC and US pseudopots for gold and only with US pseudopot for cobalt. 

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to 
  1.5 eV for Au; states are frozen from -20 eV to -2.5 eV.
  Twelve initial guess centers of atomic type are considered: 5 d-type and 1 
  s-type orbitals localized on each Au (or Co) atom (see the manual for further 
  details).

  Bulk-like conductance is calculated: leads and conductor are made of the same
  material and conductance of the ideal and infinite structure is computed.
  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.
  DOS is calculated as the trace of the conductor Green's function.


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in about 20 iterations for gold (about 40
  for AuUS and 60 for Co) and the final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is about 
  44.935 Bohr^2 for Au (40.644 Bohr^2 for AuUS and 33.240 Bohr^2 for Co), 
  3.744 Bohr^2 on average (3.387 Bohr^2 for AuUS and 2.770 Bohr^2 for Co): 
  this component of the spread will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 280 iterations Wannier convergence for gold (after 230 iterations 
  in the US case and 200 for cobalt) is achieved. A total spread of about 
  48.486 Bohr^2 for Au (43.940 Bohr^2 for AuUS, 35.232 Bohr^2 for Co) is found, 
  with an average of about 4.040 Bohr^2 for Au (3.662 Bohr^2 for AuUS, 2.936 Bohr^2 
  for Co).

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.out and
  cond*.out files.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_Au.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_Au.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_AuUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_AuUS.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_CoUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_CoUS.dat

  Conductance exhibit a stepwise behaviour due to the bulk-like calculation.
  Additional dips are present in the conductance plot compared with the calculations 
  performed with 1 atom per cell. The 2 atoms in the cell are not subjected to symmetric 
  interactions and the lack of symmetry causes gaps opening in bands structure, 
  corresponding to dips in the conductance. This behaviour could be corrected, increasing 
  the number of atoms per cell until interactions with the outermost atoms become weak.  
  Pronounced peaks are observable in the DOS plot, due to the Van Hove singularities.
