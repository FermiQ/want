@title@   Spin Polarized (LSD) Nichel Chain (USPP)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of a Nichel chain
  Using Ultrasoft pseudopotentials with collinear spin polarization. 
  Geometrical parameters are the same as in test06, cutoff energies are 20 Ry 
  for wfcs and 200 Ry for density expansions.

  Here we also set  
    nspin = 2
    starting_magnetization(1) = 0.5 
  in the DFT calculation input files, and then select the spin channel by setting 
    spin_component = "UP" or "DOWN"
  in the input files related to the WanT package.

  Note that WanT datafiles will be overwritten passing from UP to DOWN component 
  if the same postfix is specified (prefix must be the same in order to read DFT 
  data from the right file). In order to avoid overwriting of datafiles _WanT_UP 
  and _WanT_DW postfixes are used for the 2 different spins.
  Moreover also properly setting postfix, output files dos.out and cond.out 
  should be renamed manually in order to avoid overwriting.

  In both spin component cases disentangle calculation is performed within an 
  energy window ranging from -12 eV to 0 eV. Six initial guess centers of atomic 
  type are considered: 5 d-type and 1 s-type orbitals localized on Ni atom (see 
  the manual for further details). 

  Bulk-like conductance is calculated: leads and conductor are made of the same
  material and conductance of the ideal and infinite structure is computed.
  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.
  DOS is calculated as the trace of the conductor Green's function.


RESULT discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in about 10 iteration. The final invariant 
  spread for spin UP is about 14.306 Bohr^2 (2.384 Bohr^2 on average), for 
  spin DOWN is about 15.016 Bohr^2 (2.503 Bohr^2 on average): this component of 
  the spread will remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 150 iterations Wannier convergence is achieved.
  A total spread of about 14.985 Bohr^2 for spin UP is found (15.891 Bohr^2 for 
  spin DOWN), 2.497 Bohr^2 on average (2.648 Bohr^2 for spin DOWN).

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.out and
  cond*.out files.
  Transport calculations are performed considering only nearest neighbors 
  interactions (one atom per cell), therefore s band-width are slightly 
  different from the DFT ones: this is due to numerical effects because they 
  are under-converged.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_UP.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_UP.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_DW.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_DW.dat

  Conductance exhibit a stepwise behaviour due to the bulk-like calculation. 
  Conductance curves have almost the same shape for spin UP and spin DOWN, but
  they are slightly shifted one wrt the other.
  In both spin cases pronounced peaks are observable in the DOS plot, due to the 
  Van Hove singularities. The peaks are not exacltly the same and they are in 
  different positions for spin UP and spin DOWN.
