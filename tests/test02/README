@title@   FCC Transition Metals  (Cu, NC and USPP)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculation of the Wannier functions for a
  typical transition metal FCC bulk crystal as Copper. No transport
  calculation is done. Calculations are performed both with NC and US pseudopots. 
  Particular interest is connected with the cutoff convergence (both wfc and rho)
  since the augmentation charge (USPP case) is supposed to be quite hard.

  The band structure along standard symmetry lines is computed by the DFT code
  (see the files $TESTDIR/Reference/dft_band_Cu.dat, 
  $TESTDIR/Reference/dft_band_CuUS.dat)
  and then recalculated by interpolation on the Wannier function Hamiltonian.

  Disentangle calculation is performed using Bloch states up to 19.78 eV upper-
  bound for Cu NCPP, 20.04 eV for Cu with USPP. States are 
  frozen up to the Fermi energy level.
  Six initial guess centers of "1gauss" type are considered: 
  5 with d-type and 1 with s-type geometry, localized on the Cu atom (see 
  the manual for further details).


  RESULTS discussion

  Nearest neighbours b-shell vectors, computed by disentangle, DFT eigenvalues
  and frozen states are reported on the disentangle output file. Disentangle
  convergence is achieved in few iterations, depending on the number of kpts.
  The average invariant spread (disentagle output) is quite small, probably
  because of the d-like WFs.

  The wannier localization procedure is the most time consuming and
  requires few thousands of iterations. This number can change dramatically if
  the kpt mesh is made finer.

  In every case the computed localization of Wannier functions is verified:

      * Average invariant spread is small (in the range 1. -- 2. Bohr^2).

      * Final average total spreads are small ( between 2. -- 3. Bohr^2).

      * Hamiltonian matrix elements are nearly real. See the end of wannier.out 
        file where these matrix elements are reported.

      * The spatial decay of the hamiltonian on the WF basis H(R) is well behaved.

      * A comparison between DFT and interpolated Wannier band structure can be done. 
        The files to be plotted are:
            $TESTDIR/Reference/dft_bands_Cu.dat (or _CuUS for USPP)
            $TESTDIR/bands_Cu.dat (or _CuUS for USPP)

        Interpolated bands don't fit exactly DFT bands because the kpoints convergence
        is not fully achieved: it would require a further run with a (8 8 8) or 
        (10 10 10 ) kpoints grid (use kgrid.x program in $TOPDIR/utility to get 
        the grid).  The minimization procedure will be complex and will require many 
        more iteration steps, but DFT bands will be well reproduced  
        (see Souza, Marzari and Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 65, 035109, 2002)
        Even if states are frozen up to the Fermi level, bands are not perfectly 
        interpolated up to this energy because they are calculated along standard 
        symmetry lines and not on the same kpoints where the states are frozen. 

        The effect of disentangle on the Wannier subspace can be seen also in the
        files:
            $TESTDIR/SCRATCH/copper_WanT_dftband.dat (or copper_US)
            $TESTDIR/SCRATCH/copper_WanT_wanband.dat (or copper_US)
        describing Bloch eigenvalues before and after disentangle procedure.
        If the frozen states condition is present, band structures in _dftband.dat 
        and _wanband.dat files must be completely overlapping, up to the frozen energy
        level.

   Norm-conserving and Ultra-soft calculations show some small
   differences which can be safely attributed to the pseudopotentials and their 
   pseudization types.
