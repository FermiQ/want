@title@   Guanine dipole moment
==============================================================================

  The dipole moment of guanine molecule is calculated.
  DFT calculation is performed with ultrasoft pseudopotentials, using only Gamma 
  point and a cutoff of 25 Ry for wfc (while 200 for rho).
  The localization of the Wannier centers is carried out, in order to compute 
  the electronic part of the dipole moment of the molecule.
  
  The electronic part of the dipole moment is calculated as:

  Pel = 2 * e * R

  where e stands for the electronic charge and R is the Wannier centers sum of 
  the molecule.

  Wannier calculation is carried out fixing twenty-eight initial-guess centers
  of 1gauss type with s and p-type geometry.


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration, because only occupied 
  states are required in calculation. The final invariant spread (/Omega_I) is 
  about 61.261 Bohr^2, 2.188 Bohr^2 on average: this component of the spread will 
  remain unchanged during the Wannier localization.

  After about 1600 iterations Wannier convergence is achieved. A total spread of
  about 72.698 Bohr^2 is found, with an average of about 2.596 Bohr^2. 

  The dipole moment of the molecule is calculated also considering the ionic 
  contribution and is found

  P = 7.12 D

  in good agreement with previous results.
