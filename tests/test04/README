@title@   Guanine dipole moment
==============================================================================

  The dipole moment of guanine molecule is computed.
  DFT calculation is performed within ultrasoft pseudopotentials in a supercell 
  approach and with a cutoff of 25 Ry for wfc and 200 Ry for rho.
  The localization of the Wannier functions is carried out, in order to compute 
  the electronic part of the dipole moment of the molecule.
  
  The electronic contribution to the dipole moment is calculated as:

  Pel = 2 * e * R

  where e stands for the electronic charge and R is the sum of Wannier functions
  avarage position. Only valence states must be conbsidered in order to compute
  dipole or polarization. Therefore the number of WFs is the same as the number 
  of occupied states (bands).

  Wannier calculation is carried out fixing twenty-eight initial-guess centers
  of 1gauss type with s and p-type geometry.


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration, because only occupied 
  states are required in the calculation. The final invariant spread (\Omega_I) is 
  about 61.261 Bohr^2, 2.188 Bohr^2 on average. 

  After about 1600 iterations Wannier convergence is achieved. A total spread of
  about 72.698 Bohr^2 is found, with an average of about 2.596 Bohr^2. 
  As a rule of thumb, Wannier localization within the valence subspace 
  (no disentanglement), turns out to be easier.

  The dipole moment of the molecule is calculated also considering the ionic 
  contribution and is found to be:

  P = 7.12 D

  in good agreement with results in the literature.
