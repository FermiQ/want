@title@   Unfolding of band structure
==============================================================================

  DESCRIPTION:

  Given a calculation at gamma of a system with a higher translations
  symmetry, use the unfold.x utility to determine and interpolate
  the band structure (and eventually DOS, etc).

  JOB SEQUENCE:
  pw.x + disentangle.x + wannier.x
  unfold.x
  bands.x, dos.x, etc
