@title@   Conductance of C-C chains (general geometry)
==============================================================================

Calculation of valence band transmittance for a dimerized Carbon chain (polyyne).
The computation is first done for bulk case.
Then the same is done coupling different lead and conductor
calculations: 4 atoms per cell have been used for the leads while 
8 for the conductor. We used 8 kpts along chain direction for the leads and 
4 kpts for the conductor to sampling Brillouin zone, and a cutoff of 20 Ry for wfc
(while 200 Ry for rho). 

The output of the calculations are the conductance (namely the transmittance) 
and dos for the bulk case (cond_bulk.dat and dos_bulk.dat) and for the general
geometry case (cond.dat and dos.dat).

The difference between the two (results from conductor are less converged) is due
to the number of atoms in the lead cell giving rise to a poor description of the
so-called "principal layer" (you can try to increase the number of atoms to larger
values in the lead and conductor calculations).
