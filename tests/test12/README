@title@   Bulk Silicon and Graphite in hexagonal cells
==============================================================================

This test shows how to use parallel (in-plane) k-points to compute
transport properties. We perform calculations both for Silicon and Graphite
bulk.

In the case of Silicon, we compute valence and conduction bands using a
hexagonal cell including 12 atoms.  We perform the calculation of transport along 
the Si[111] direction, using the kpt-techniques to describe the in-plane 
(i.e. orthogonal to transport direction) dispersion of silicon.
This part of the test might be quite time-consuming, especially for the 
localization of Wannier functions.

After the localization of WFs, transport is computed interpolating 
the in-plane kpts ( nk(:) variables); symmetry (time-reversal, use_symm = .TRUE.) 
is exploited to reduce the global overhead. 
Anyway, the results for transport are obtained with a minimum 2D kpt-mesh and
should be considered out-of-convergence.
Note the use of gaussian smearing both in dos.in and conductor.in: dos.dat and
doscond.dat take trace of that and are quite similar (even if not identical since 
the two calculations are different and not converged).

The same chain of calculations is performed also for the case of Graphite, 
computing transport properties in the direction orthogonal to the graphene planes.
Due to the smaller cell, calculations are much faster. We remark the use of 
conditioned minimization in the iterative procedure for WF localization.
We also interpolate the band structure using WFs (reasults in bands_graphite.dat);
for a comparison see eg: G.S. Painter and D.E. Ellis, Phys.Rev. B 1, 4747 (1970).
