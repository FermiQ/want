ABOUT WanT
==========================

WanT is an open-source, GNU General Public License suite of codes that provides an 
integrated approach for the study of coherent electronic transport in nanostructures. 
The core methodology combines state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory (DFT), 
plane-wave, norm-conserving pseudopotentials calculations with a Green's functions 
method based on the Landauer formalism to describe quantum conductance. The 
essential connection between the two, and a crucial step in the calculation, is 
the use of the maximally-localized Wannier function representation to 
introduce naturally the ground-state electronic structure into the lattice 
Green's function approach at the basis of the evaluation of the quantum conductance. 
Moreover, the knowledge of the Wannier functions of the system allows for the direct 
link between the electronic transport properties of the device with the nature of the 
chemical bonds, providing insight onto the mechanisms that govern electron flow at the 
nanoscale.

The WanT package operates, in principles, as a simple post-processing of any standard 
electronic structure code. The WanT code is currently interfaced to the codes in the
Quantum-ESPRESSO distribution (http://www.quantum-espresso.org, http://www.pwscf.org).


==========================
WanT FEATURES
==========================

WanT calculations will provide the user with:
- Quantum conductance spectrum for a bulk (infinite, periodic) system and for a
  lead-conductor-lead geometry
- Density of states spectrum in the conductor region
- Centers and spreads of the maximally-localized Wannier functions of the system
