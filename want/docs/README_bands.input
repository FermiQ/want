NAMELIST &INPUT

prefix        STRING
              the first part of the name of all the file written by the code
              should be equal to the value given in the main calculations.
              DEFAULT: mandatory

postfix       STRING
              the tail of the names of the above mentioned files (useful e.g. to
              distinguish among different calculations having a common part).
              should be equal to the value given in the main calculations.
              DEFAULT: ""

work_dir      STRING
              the scratch directory where the massive data file will be written
              DEFAULT: "./"

datafile_dft  STRING
              the name of the datafile for DFT when importing data from 
              CRYSTAL06.
              DEFAULT: " "

fileout       STRING
              the file used to write the computed BANDS.
              DEFAULT: "$work_dir/$prefix$suffix_bands.dat"

nkpts_in      INTEGER
              number of edge kpts defining the directions on which bands will
              be calculated
              DEFAULT: mandatory

nkpts_max     INTEGER
              maximum number of interpolated kpoints
              DEFAULT: 100

use_nn(3)     LOGICAL
              if .TRUE. along direction i, only nearest neighbors Hamiltonians along i
              are used to compute bands. Useful to compare with transport calculation.
              DEFAULT : .FALSE., .FALSE., .FLASE.

datafile_sgm  STRING
              If specified, the code reads the file to search for a static (and hermitean)
              self-energy operator to be taken into account in the interpolation of the bands.
              DEFAULT : ""


==============================================================================

After the INPUT namelist for each of the NSPTS kpts two lines with the following
format must be provided:

kpt_label    kx  ky  kz

   kpt_label     CHARACTER(*)
                 it is a string with the name of the kpoint

   kx,ky,kz      REAL
                 component of the kpt vector in units of crystal reciprocal 
                 lattice vector (i.e. k = kx * b1 + ky * b2 + kz * b3)
