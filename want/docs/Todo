  List of needed changes
*************************************

* plot.x: USPP features not fully implemented.
* log file (changes in the timing routine)
* direct calculation of the current

* tests:  check script
* tests:  run script 

* Symmetries in wfc management

* Wannier and Transport parallelization

* disentangle + wannier: 
     - wfc stored in a k-indip array (waste small mem but
       increase performance)
     - scalar products in projections and overlaps by BLAS
               
* eigenchannel in transport calculation

* eigenvalue problem in wannier localization
