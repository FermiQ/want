INPUT file layout
-----------------------------------

&INPUT

-----------------------------------

prefix        STRING
              the first part of the name of all the file written by the code
              should be equal to the value given in the main calculations.
              DEFAULT: mandatory

postfix       STRING
              the tail of the names of the above mentioned files (useful e.g. to
              distinguish among different calculations having a common part).
              should be equal to the value given in the main calculations.
              DEFAULT: ""

work_dir      STRING
              the scratch directory where the massive data file will be written
              DEFAULT: "./"

wann          STRING       
              specifies the indexes of the Wannier functions to be plotted.
              It is a string of format e.g "1-3,5,7-9" (analogous to the fmt used
              to specify pages to very common print tools)
              DEFAULT: mandatory

datatype      STRING
              ("modulus" | "real" | "imaginary")
              specifies the type of data plotted:
                "modulus":    plot the real space square modulus of the WFs.
                "real":       plot the real part (in real space) of the WFs.
                "imaginary":  plot the imaginary part (in real space) of the WFs
                              this choice shouldbe intended as a check because WFs
                              are expected to be more or less "real".
              DEFAULT: "modulus"

output_fmt    STRING
              ( "plt" | "txt" | "cube" | "xsf" )
              Define the format of the output file. PLT is binary and smaller than
              CUBE, XSF (read by XCRYSDEN) and TXT. While CUBE and XSF deals also with 
              non-orthorombic lattices, TXT is suitable to be converted to further format.
              DEFAULT: "plt"

nr1, nr2, nr3 INTEGER
              The dimensions of the FFT mesh used to move WFs to real space.
              These dimensions are related to the crystal unit cell and should not be smaller
              than the those read from DFT datafile.
              DEFAULT: DFT FFT dimensions

r1min, r1max  REAL
              the starting and ending points of the plotting cell along a1 dir, 
              in units of a1 lattice vector (crystal coord.).
              DEFAULT: -0.5, 0.5

r2min, r2max  REAL
              as before but for a2 direction.
              DEFAULT: -0.5, 0.5
             
r3min, r3max  REAL
              as before but for a3 direction.
              DEFAULT: -0.5, 0.5
              
assume_ncpp   LOGICAL
              if using DFT pseudoptentials not readable in WanT set this value to 
              .TRUE. in order to avoid PP reading.
              DEFAULT: .FALSE.

uspp_augmentation   LOGICAL
              if .TRUE. and we are using USPP, the augmentation part of the charge
              associated to WFs is computed. It is quite time consuming.
              DEFAULT: .FALSE.

collect_wf    LOGICAL
              if .TRUE. move the WFs in a unit cell centerd around the midpoint of the 
              plotting cell. Useful to plot purposes.
              DEFAULT: .TRUE.
