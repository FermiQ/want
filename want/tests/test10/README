@title@   Conductance of C-C chains (general geometry)
==============================================================================

  Calculation of valence band transmittance for a dimerized Carbon chain (polyyne).
  The computation is first done for bulk case.
  Then the same is done coupling different lead and conductor calculations: 4 
  atoms per cell have been used for the leads while 8 for the conductor. We used 
  8 kpts along chain direction for the leads and 4 kpts for the conductor to 
  sampling Brillouin zone, and a cutoff of 20 Ry for wfc (while 200 Ry for rho). 

  The output of the calculations are the conductance (namely the transmittance) 
  and dos for the bulk case (cond_bulk.dat and dos_bulk.dat) and for the general
  geometry case (cond.dat and dos.dat). 
  A further geometry is considered: transport calculation is carried out coupling 
  conductor (8 atom per cell, 16 WFs) with leads (4 atoms, 8 WFs), extracting the 
  coupling matrices directly from the supercell conductor calculation (see the 
  manual for further details). Calculated conductance and dos are in the output 
  files cond_auto.dat and dos_auto.dat. 

  Disentangle calculation is performed for conductor within an energy window 
  ranging up to -4.1536522 eV (-4.125121128 for leads). A conditioned minimization 
  is carried out and the amplitude of the penalty functional is set to 10 (see 
  manual for further details). Sixteen initial guess centers of 1gauss type are 
  considered: 1 center (with s-geometry) or 3 centers (1 with s-geometry and 2 with 
  p-geometry) are localized at the single or triple bond midpoints between C atoms.

  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.
  DOS is calculated as the trace of conductor Green's function.


RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration, because only occupied 
  states are required in calculation. The final invariant spread for conductor is 
  about 54.594 Bohr^2 (3.412 Bohr^2 on average), for leads is about 25.024 Bohr^2 
  (3.128 Bohr^2 on average): this component of the spread will remain unchanged 
  during the Wannier localization.

  After about 610 iterations (350 for leads) Wannier convergence for conductor is 
  achieved. A total spread of about 65.785 Bohr^2 for conductor is found 
  (30.747 Bohr^2 for leads), 4.111 Bohr^2 on average (3.843 Bohr^2 for leads).

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.out and
  cond*.out files.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_bulk.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_bulk.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond.dat and $TESTDIR/dos.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_auto.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_auto.dat

  In the bulk-like calculation conductance exhibit a stepwise behaviour, with the
  presence of a dip due to the lack of symmetry in the interactions simulated with 
  8 atoms per cell. This stepwise behaviour results dramatically changed in the 
  general geometry calculation (in particular near the Fermi energy level of the 
  leads). This is due to numerical effects in matching the hamiltonian matrices of 
  conductor and leads at the boundary (see the manual for further details). In the 
  "auto" calcualtion the conductance curve is irregular only near the Fermi energy, 
  while it is well reproduced at lower energies. Interface principal layers, used 
  in matching conductor and leads and extracted from conductor supercell calculation, 
  could be not completely equivalent. 
  In every geometry considered, pronounced peaks are observable in the DOS plot, due 
  to the Van Hove singularities. The peaks are not exacltly the same (with the same 
  height) for all geometries. The DOS curve is affected by numerical effects rising 
  from conductor-leads matching. 

  The difference between the bulk case and the general geometry (results from 
  conductor are less converged) is due to the number of atoms in the lead cell 
  giving rise to a poor description of the so-called "principal layer" (you can try 
  to increase the number of atoms to larger values in the lead and conductor 
  calculations).
