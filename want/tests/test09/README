@title@   Spin Polarized (LSD) Nichel Chain (USPP)
==============================================================================

This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of a Nichel chain
Using Ultrasoft pseudopotentials with collinear spin polarization. 
Geometrical parameters are the same as in Test5, cutoff energies are 20 Ry 
for wfcs and 200 Ry for density expansions.

Here we also set  
  nspin = 2
  starting_magnetization(1) = 0.5 
in the DFT calculation input files, and then select the spin channel by 
setting 
  spin_component = "UP" or "DOWN"
in the input files related to the WanT package.

Note that for the moment WanT datafile will be OVERWRITTEN passing from
UP to DOWN component if the same postfix is specified (prefix
must be the same in order to read DFT data from the right file).
Moreover also properly setting postfix, output files of hamiltonian.x
(RHAM.xxx) and bulk.x / conductor.x (dos.out, cond.out) should be
renamed manually in order to avoid overwriting.
