  Calculation of conductance for a Pt-H2-Pt junction. The calculation is done 
  setting a chain of 8 Pt atoms with an H2 molecule between them in the unit cell.
  We used 4 kpts along chain direction to sample the Brillouin zone, and a cutoff 
  of 22 Ry for wfc (while 176 Ry for rho).

  The output of the calculations are the conductance (namely the transmittance)
  and the DOS for the bulk-like platinum leads (cond_bulk.dat and dos_bulk.dat) and 
  for the general geometry of platinum leads contacted through the H2 molecule 
  (cond.dat and dos.dat).
  transport calculation is carried out coupling conductor (8 Pt and 2 H atoms 
  per cell, 50 WFs) with leads (1 Pt atom, 6 WFs), extracting the coupling 
  matrices directly from the supercell conductor calculation (see the manual for 
  further details). 

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to 
  10 eV. A conditioned minimization is carried out and the amplitude of the 
  penalty functional is set to 20 (see manual for further details). Fifty initial 
  guess centers are considered: 10 of 1gauss type with s-geometry are localized 
  at the bond midpoints, and 5 d-type atomic orbitals are localized on each Pt 
  atom.


RESULTS discussion

  After 2000 iterations the disentangle procedure is not fully converged, but
  can be considered adeguate. An almost fine localization is reached by wannier.x 

  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_bulk.dat   and   $TESTDIR/doscond_bulk.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond.dat        and   $TESTDIR/doscond.dat

  In the bulk-like calculation, conductance exhibits a stepwise behavior, with the
  presence of dips due to the lack of symmetry in the simulated interactions. 
  When we compute the transmittance for the Pt-H2-Pt junction we observe the 
  depletion of large part of the Pt d channels. Again, numerical noise (basically
  connected with the matching procedure when small cells are used, as in the present 
  case) produces some dips in the transmittance (and in the DOS correspondingly).

  Results may be checked with a published work which uses the same approach based
  on Wannier functions: 
    K.S. Thygesen and K.W. Jacobsen, Chem. Phys. 319, 111-125 (2005). 

  As an example, we also compute the current in the "linear regime", i.e. considering
  the transmittance indipendend on the applied bias. The output result is given
  in the file $TESTDIR/current.dat .
