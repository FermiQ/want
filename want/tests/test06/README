@title@   Gold and Cobalt chains (NCPP and USPP)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculations for the bulk conductance of Gold and 
  Cobalt chains, using both NC and US pseudopotentials in the Gold case, only 
  US for Cobalt. 
  Calculations are done setting one atom in the unit cell, using a 
  (1 1 4, 0 0 1) (according to PWSCF notation) Monkhorst-Pack grid in the SCF 
  run and a (1 1 4, 0 0 0) grid in the NSCF run. 
  The wave-function and charge-density cutoff in the NCPP case has been chosen 
  to be 20 Ry in order to make the test running fast, but results are of course 
  not converged. A cutoff of 40 Ry or more will lead to more physical results.
  In the USPP case instead, cutoff of 20 and 200 Ry are used for wfc and rho 
  respectively. Note the larger ratio for wfc/rho cutoffs is due to the 
  hardness of augmentation charges needed in the USPP case.

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to
  2 eV for Au with NC pseudopotential (1.8 eV for AuUS); states are frozen up
  to -2 eV. Wannier functions for the s-d manifold (6-dim) of Gold are computed.

  Bulk-like conductance is calculated: leads and conductor are made of the same 
  material and conductance of the ideal and infinite structure is computed.
  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.
  DOS is calculated as the trace of the conductor Green's function.


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration for gold, because within 
  the considered energy window gold bands are already disentagled (even if not
  fully occupied, as in the case of the valence manyfold in semiconductors); 
  the convergence in the Cobalt case requires about 120 iterations. 
  The final invariant spread is about 22.209 Bohr^2 for Au (3.702 Bohr^2 on average), 
  20.995 Bohr^2 for AuUS (3.499 Bohr^2 on average) and 16.901 Bohr^2 for Co 
  (2.817 Bohr^2 on average).

  After about 300 iterations Wannier convergence for Gold is achieved (340 for Cobalt).
  A total spread of about 23.773 Bohr^2 for Au is found (22.899 Bohr^2 for AuUS,
  17.604 Bohr^2 for Co), 3.955 Bohr^2 on average (3.816 Bohr^2 for AuUS, 2.934 Bohr^2
  for Co). 

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.dat and 
  cond*.dat files.
  Transport calculations are performed considering nearest neighbors interactions
  between principal layers (one atom per cell): s band-width are thus slightly 
  different from the DFT ones. We are essentially setting to zero higher order
  interaction terms (further neighbours) which are for sure non-negligible 
  due to the small cell used.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_Au.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_Au.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_AuUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_AuUS.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_CoUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_CoUS.dat

  Conductance exhibits stepwise behaviour which is a typical bulk-like feature.
  Pronounced peaks are present in the DOS plot, due to the 1D van Hove 
  singularities (1/SQRT(E) devergencies at the band edges).
 
  Note that the final conductance in the Au and AuUS cases are slightly different 
  probably due to the different convergence level between NC and USPP (the second 
  case is closer to convergence, which is around 25 Ry for wfc and 200 Ry for rho 
  cutoff energies).
