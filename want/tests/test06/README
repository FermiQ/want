@title@   Gold and Cobalt chains (NCPP and USPP)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculations for the bulk conductance of Gold and 
  Cobalt chains, using both NC and US pseudopotentials in the gold case, only 
  US for cobalt. 
  The calculation is done setting one atom in the unit cell, using a 
  (1 1 4, 0 0 1) (according to PWSCF notation) Monkrost-Pack grid in the SCF 
  run and a (1 1 4, 0 0 0) grid in the NSCF run. 
  The wave-function and charge-density cutoff in the NCPP case has been chosen 
  to be 20 Ry in order to make the test running fast, but results are of course 
  not converged. A cutoff of 40 Ry or more will lead to more physical results.
  In the USPP case instead cutoff of 20 and 200 Ry are used for wfc and rho 
  respectively. Note the larger ratio wfc/rho cutoffs which is due to the 
  hardness of augmentation charges needed within USPP.

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging up to
  2 eV for Au with NC pseudopotential (1.8 eV for AuUS); states are frozen up
  to -2 eV. Wannier functions for the s-d manifold (6-dim) of Gold are computed.

  Bulk-like conductance is calculated: leads and conductor are made of the same 
  material and conductance of the ideal and infinite structure is computed.
  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.


  RESULTS discussion

  Disentangle convergence is achieved in only 1 iteration for gold, beacuse only
  occupied states are considered in calculation; the convergence in the cobalt case 
  requires about 120 iterations. The final invariant spread is about 22.209 Bohr^2 
  for Au (3.702 Bohr^2 on average), 20.995 Bohr^2 for AuUS (3.499 Bohr^2 on average)
  and 16.901 Bohr^2 for Co (2.817 Bohr^2 on average).

  After about 300 iterations Wannier convergence for gold is achieved (340 for cobalt).
  A total spread of about 23.773 Bohr^2 for Au is found (22.899 Bohr^2 for AuUS,
  17.604 Bohr^2 for Co), 3.955 Bohr^2 on average (3.816 Bohr^2 for AuUS, 2.934 Bohr^2
  for Co). 

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.out and 
  cond*.out files.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond_Au.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_Au.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_AuUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_AuUS.dat
     $TESTDIR/cond_CoUS.dat and $TESTDIR/dos_CoUS.dat

  Conductance exhibit a stepwise behaviour due to the bulk-like calculation.
  Pronounced peaks are observable in the DOS plot, due to the Van Hove singularities.
 
  Note that the final conductance in the Au and AuUS cases are slightly different 
  probably due to the different convergence level between NC and USPP (the second 
  case is more close to convergence, which is around 25 Ry for wfc and 200 Ry for rho 
  cutoff energies).
