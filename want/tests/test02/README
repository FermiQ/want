@title@   FCC Transition Metals  (Co and Cu, NC and USPP)
==============================================================================

This test performs the calculation of the wannier functions for some
typical transition metal FCC bulk crystals, such as Cu and Co.
Calculations are performed both with NC and US pseudopots.
Particular interest is connected with the cutoff convergence (both wfc and rho)
in the Co case where the augmentation charge is supposed to be quite hard.
