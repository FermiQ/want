@title@   Hydrogen chains; check interface to CRYSTAL09 (http://www.crystal.polito.it)
==============================================================================

  In this test we compare post-processing calculations done using WanT
  starting from Qauntum-ESPRESSO (QE) or CRYSTAL09 (CRY) data.
  As a model system we consider a one dimension chain of equispaced 
  Hydrogen atoms (this system is instable and would undergo a Pierls
  distortion, but here ions are kept fixed).

  The electronic structure of this system is computed from crystal data
  using both LDA and HF, and both spin un-polarized and polarized
  calculations. The density of states, band structure and bulk 
  transmittance are computed.

  In the case of ispin-unpolarized LDA, the CRYSTAL09 results can be compared
  with those from QE. The principal layers of the transport calculation are
  made of 6 Hydrogen atoms and their size turns out to be converged since
  the DOS calculated from dos.x is in good agreement (band edges, in particular) 
  with those computed by conductor.x . The existing differences are due to
  a much larger and different smearing used in dos.x input files.
