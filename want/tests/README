   TESTs
==============================================================================

 * HOW TO set up the environment
     In order to get started with running tests you should modify the
     environment.conf file in this directory according to your system.
     You should provide the location of DFT calculation executables 
     (i.e. PWscf) and the directory that will be used for temporary files
     (scratch). In the case of parallel machine you are also requested to 
     specify some special commands to run the DFT within an MPI environment.

 * HOW TO run the tests
     After this operation you can start running tests both by using the 
     simple Makefile system implemented here (type make to get an help) or
     by cd-ing in the test directories and typing ./run.sh <FLAG>. 
     The list of possible flag is printed in output with a simple explaination
     executing ./run.sh (typical flags are <FLAG> scf, nscf, disentangle
     with obvious meaning). If you type ./run.sh all the test will be 
     completely performed. 

 * HOW TO check the tests
     In each test directory you will find a further dir called "Reference"
     containing all the reference output files previously produced. 
     You are advised to check your output with a simple diff command:
        diff myreport.out Reference/myreport.out
     In doing this remenber that not all the quantities are expected to be
     the same. 

 * HOW TO understand the tests
     In each test directory you will find a README file describing the 
     physics of the tests and the results obtained in WanT output files.
     Moreover also some tricky and subtle questions about WanT input
     data are raised and discussed.
