@title@   Aluminum Chain (within disentangle)
==============================================================================

  This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of an Aluminum 
  chain. It is different wrt test06 because of the entangled conduction band of   
  Al. The calculation is done setting one atom in the unit cell, using a 
  (1 1 40, 0 0 1) (according to PWSCF notation) Monkrost-Pack grid in the SCF 
  run and a (1 1 20, 0 0 0) grid in the NSCF run. The wave-function and charge-
  density cutoff has been chosen to be 15 Ry which can be considered converged. 

  The 1D Aluminum has an entangled sp band which is extracted from a large 
  manyfold using the disentangle code. The original DFT eigenvalues are 
  accordingly slightly changed. After the Wannier minimization the interpolated 
  band structure (file band.dat) should exactly reproduce the eigs written by 
  disentangle.

  Disentangle calculation is performed within an energy window ranging from 
  -20 eV to 10 eV. Four initial guess centers of 1gauss type are considered:
  3 with p-type and 1 with s-type geometry, localized on the Al atom (see the 
  manual for further details).

  Bulk-like conductance is calculated: leads and conductor are made of the same
  material and conductance of the ideal and infinite structure is computed.
  Quantum conductance calculation is performed according to the Landauer formula.
  DOS is calculated as the trace of the conductor Green's function.


  RESULTS discussion

  After 500 iterations Disentangle convergence is not fully achieved but
  can be considered adequate. The final invariant spread is about 25.724 Bohr^2
  (6.431 Bohr^2 on average): this component of the spread will remain unchanged 
  during the Wannier localization.
  
  After about 520 iterations Wannier convergence is achieved.
  A total spread of about 36.945 Bohr^2 is found, 9.236 Bohr^2 on average.

  The main outputs of the transport calculation are written in the dos*.out and
  cond*.out files.
  Transport calculations are performed considering only nearest neighbors interactions
  (one atom per cell), therefore s band-width are slightly different from the DFT ones:
  this is due to numerical effects because they are under-converged.
  Transport calculation results are plotted in files:
     $TESTDIR/cond.dat 
     $TESTDIR/dos.dat

  Conductance exhibit a stepwise behaviour due to the bulk-like calculation.
  Pronounced peaks are observable in the DOS plot, due to the Van Hove singularities.
