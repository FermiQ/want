TEST04   Aluminum Chain (within disentangle)
==============================================================================

This test performs the calculation for the bulk conductance of an Aluminum chain.
It is different wrt test2 because of the entangled conduction band of Al.
The calculation is done setting one atom in the unit cell, using a (1 1 40, 0 0 1) 
(according to PWSCF notation) Monkrost-Pack grid in the SCF run and a (1 1 20, 0 0 0) 
grid in the NSCF run. The wave-function and charge-density cutoff has been chosen 
to be 15 Ry which can be considered converged. 
The 1D Aluminum has and entangled sp bands which is extracted from a large manyfold
using the disentangle code. The original DFT eigenvalues are accordingly slightly
changed and written to the energies.dat file. After the Wannier minimization the
interpolated band structure (file band.dat) should exactly reproduce the eigs
written by disentangle.
